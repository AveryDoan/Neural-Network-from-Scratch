# Neural Network from Scratch

A modular and educational implementation of a neural network built only with `numpy`. This project is designed to help you understand the inner workings of neural networks by breaking them down into customizable components.

## Project Structure

- `neural_network.py`: Core modular components (`Linear`, `ReLU`, `Sequential`, etc.).
- `main.ipynb`: Interactive Jupyter notebook for building, training, and customizing your network.
- `test_modules.py`: Test suite for gradient checking and convergence verification.

## Features

- **Modular Architecture**: Easy to swap activations or add layers.
- **Educational Comments**: Detailed explanations of the math in each component.
- **Gradient Checking**: Verified backward pass accuracy.
- **Interactive Playground**: Customize learning rate, hidden units, and more in the notebook.

## How to use

1. Open `main.ipynb`.
2. Modify parameters in the "Customize These Parameters" section.
3. Run all cells to train and visualize.
